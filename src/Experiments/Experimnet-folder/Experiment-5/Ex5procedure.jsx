      Initially make sure you understand what each component of the spectrometer
      as detailed in Fig. (5.5) does. The experimental setup consists of
      following parts. To obtain satisfactory

      results the spectroscope requires some initial adjustments before the
      desired measurements can be performed. For this experiment great care must
      be taken in adjusting the spectrometer so that the telescope is focused at
      infinity and the collimator set to give an accurately parallel beam. It is
      particularly important to ensure that the cross-hairs of the telescope are
      sharply visible and that no parallax exists between them and the spectral
      line images. The following steps should ensure this:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Focusing the telescope: Focus the telescope for the parallel rays from
      the distance object by sliding the eyepiece looking through telescope in
      and out, until a sharp image of object is seen. Due to the location of the
      laboratory this may not be possible so the building opposite may be used
      for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Levelling the collimator: Place the spirit level on the collimator tube
      with its axis parallel to the axis of the tube. If the the bubble in the
      collimator is found to be displaced from its central position, turn the
      levelling screws provided with the collimator tube, in the same direction
      to bring the bubble back to its central position. This make the axis of
      the collimator tube horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Levelling of the prism table: There are three levelling screws A, B, C
      just below the prism table for levelling the table. There are parallel
      lines drawn on the prism table parallel to the line joining the screws B
      and C. Place the spirit level parallel to these lines and bring the bubble
      to the central position by turning the screws B and C equally in opposite
      directions. Now place the spirit level perpendicular to the line BC. If
      the bubble is not in the central position, then turn the A screw alone to
      bring the bubble in the center. Continue this for a couple of times until
      the bubble is in the center in both the positions. This makes the table
      vertical to the axis of rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Focusing the collimator: Place a discharge lamp (Mercury lamp as a
      visible light source) in front of the spectroscope and turn the telescope
      until it is in line with and pointing directly at the collimator. Looking
      through the telescope and adjusting the position of the focusing screw on
      the collimeter until a sharp image of the slit is observed in the
      telescope. The collimeter now gives parallel rays which will fall on the
      prism.

      <b>Measurement of the angle of prism (A)</b>

    <p>
      1. Set up the prism and spectrometer as in Fig. (5.6). Lock the prism
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Place the telescope cross-hairs in turn on the image of the slit
      reflected from surface AB and then surface AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. At each position record the angular position of the telescope on the
      vernier scalethe angle between the two positions of the telescope is 2A,
      twice the apex angle of the prism and hence A can be found.
    </p>
    <p>4. Repeat above step 2 and 3 to get an average value for A(~60°).</p>
    <h5>
      <b>Viewing the spectrum due to refraction</b>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The telescope and prism are rotated until the spectrum formed by
      refraction is found. The approximate prism position is shown in Fig. 5.7.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further rotation of the prism while viewing the spectrum through the
      telescope will result in reaching the angle of minimum deviation. This is
      where the spectral lines “turn back" on themselves i.e. move opposite to
      their initial direction of travel while the prism is still being rotated
      in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Position the prism and telescope so that the spectral lines are at the
      angle of minimum deviation i.e. at the point where the spectral lines
      “turn back" on themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Position the prism and telescope so that the spectral lines are at the
      angle of minimum deviation i.e. at the point where the spectral lines
      “turn back" on themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning the prism towards the telescope, increases the angle of incidence,
      thus moving to the right hand side of δmin in the curve of Fig. (5.3).
      Conversely turning the prism towards the collimator, decreases the angle
      of incidence, hence moving through the angle of minimum deviation to the
      left hand side of the curve of Fig. 5.3.

      1. Using the Hg spectral lamp, observe the first order field of view of
      refracted spectrum. Find the point of minimum deviation for the Hg
      spectrum. The approximate prism position is as shown in Fig. 5.7.

    <p>
      (Remember minimum deviation corresponds to the point at which movement of
      the lines of the Hg spectrum over the field of view of the telescope is
      reversed, although direction of rotation of the telescope continues in the
      same sense.)
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Several spectral lines should be in the field of view of the telescope.
      Position the telescope on the highest wavelength spectral line and lock
      the prism table and telescope. It is essential that the prism and prism
      table remain in this position for the remainder of the experiment
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Using the telescope fine adjustment screw, position the crosshairs of
      the telescope accurately on the spectral line of interest and read the
      vernier to the nearest minute of arc
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The above step can be repeated for the other lines in the field of view
      of the telescope there should be enough movement in the telescope fine
      adjustment screw to allow positioning of the cross-hairs on all of the Hg
      spectral lines of Table 5.1 without unlocking the telescope again. If this
      is not the case, just unlock the telescope and reposition it such that the
      crosshairs of the eyepiece are on the spectral line of interest. It is
      imperative that the prism and prism table remain in their original fixed
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Rotate the telescope anticlockwise until the undeviated image of the
      slit through the prism is in the field of view. Again position the
      crosshairs on the centre of the clit image and record the angular reading
      of the telescope on the vernier scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The actual value for δmin for each wavelength is the difference between
      the appropriate angular reading of the telescope position for minimum
      deviation and for the undeviated (straight through) position as seen in
      Fig. (5.1)
