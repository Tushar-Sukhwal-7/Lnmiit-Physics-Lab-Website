        <b>Apparatus Required :</b>
      </h4>
      <p>Stop watch, long bar, meter scale, knife edge.</p>
      <h4>
        <b>Procedure :</b>
      </h4>
      <p>
        1. Balance the bar on sharp wedge and mark the position of its center of
        gravity (C.G.).
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Ensure that the frame on which movable knife edge / pivot is to be
        rested is hori- zontal.

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Suspend the pendulum in the first hole. The knife edge or pivot
        should be placed on the glass plate as shown in Fig. 2.2.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The distance d is the distance between point of suspension (bottom of
        the hole) and the C.G.
      </p>
      <p>5. Start the oscillation of the pendulum.</p>
      <p>
        6. Use the stop watch to measure the time for 10 oscillations. The time
        should be measured after the pendulum has had a few oscillations and the
        oscillations have become regular.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Repeat the process by suspending the pendulum in the consecutive
        holes.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Draw a graph by taking distance along X-axis and time period along Y
        -axis as shown in Fig. 2.3. Shift the axes to draw a full page graph.
      </p>

      <h4>
        <b>Calculation :</b>
      </h4>
      <p />
      <p>
        1. With the help of the graph, distance d 1 and d 2 can be measured from
        which the value of g can be calculated by using formulas
      </p>
      <p>
        where d 1 and d 2 the distances M 1 A 1 , M 1 B 1 respectively and T is
        the time CM 1 as shown in Fig. 2.3. As there are two branches one could
        take the mean of Q 1 M 1 and M 1 A 1 for the distance d 1 and mean of P
        1 M 1 and M 1 B 1 for the distance d 2 for substitution in this formula.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Choose another line P 2 B 2 and find g 2 using Eqns. (2.20) and
        (2.21), where d 1 is the mean of Q 2 M 2 and M 2 A 2 , d 2 is the mean
        of P 2 M 2 and M 2 B 2 and T = CM 2 .
      </p>
      <p>
        3. At the minima, ensure that P 3 M 3 is equal to M 3 B 3 . Then
        calculate g 3 via the formula
      </p>
      <p>4. Find the average value of g.</p>
      <p />
      <h4>
        <b>Theoretical Error :</b>
      </h4>
      <p />
      <p>Acceleration due to gravity (g) is given by the formula</p>
      <p>Taking log and differentiating</p>
      <p>Thus, maximum possible error = ................%.</p>
      <p />
      <h4>
        <b>Results :</b>
      </h4>
      <p />
      <p>The standard value of g = ..............m/sec 2 .</p>
      <p>Percentage error = ...............%.</p>
      <p />
      <h4>
        <b>Precaution :</b>
      </h4>
      <p />
      <p>
        1. The Knife edge is made horizontal. If it is not perfectly horizontal
        the bar may be twisted while swinging.
      </p>
      <p>2. The motion of a bar should be strictly in a vertical plane.</p>
      <p>3. The amplitude of the swing should be small.</p>
      <p>
        4. The time period of oscillations should be determined by measuring
        time by large number of oscillations with an accurate stop watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. All distances should be measured and plotted from one end of the rod.
