  <h4>
    <b>Apparatus Required :</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Newton’s ring microscope, sodium vapour lamp, circular slit plate, light
    emitting diode source
  </p>
  <h4>
    <b>Procedure</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    1. The Newton’s ring microscope has two parts, (i) microscope with
    horizontal measurement and (ii) a Newton’s ring assembly. First detach the
    Newton’s ring assembly and clean the adjustable glass plate, plano-convex
    lens and its adjoining glass plate with a clean cloth.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Replace the plano-convex lens over the glass plate and tight them
    carefully with the help of three leveling screws (if present). An
    interference ring pattern can be observed with the naked eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Arrange the Newton’s ring assembly as shown in Fig. 6.5. Note that the
    glass plate P' should be inclined at 45° with respect to the vertical plain.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. First connect the sodium vapour lamp power supply with mains. Then
    connect it with the light source box with the help of mains cord. Then
    switch ON the power supply.
  </p>
  <p>5. Wait for 30 minutes till the lamp glow bright yellowish.</p>
  <p>
    6. Insert circular slit plate into the slit-holder. Adjust to fully
    illuminate glass plate P' inclined at 45°.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Calculate the least count of the traveling microscope (M). If p is the
    pitch of the micrometer screw in cm, and m is the number of divisions on the
    circular scale, then least count is p/m in cm.
  </p>
  <p>8. Take a view through the eye piece of the tube as shown in Fig. 6.6.</p>
  <p>
    9. There are two type of movements provided in the microscope, coarse and
    fine. Align the microscope tube, with the help of coarse movement knob nos.
    2 and 4 as shown in Fig. 6.6, to bring it over the glass plate P'.

  </p>
  <p>
    10. Now move the microscope tube with the help of fine movement knob no. 3
    close to the plate P' to obtain clear image of surface. Slowly move towards
    upward direction. Newton’s rings pattern is observed. Adjust by moving the
    microscope to and fro, if necessary, to view the full pattern. Adjust
    further for better contrast between bright and dark fringes.
  </p>
  <p>
    11. Bring the cross-wire, using knob no. 1 shown in Fig. 6.6, in the central
    fringe such that their centre should coincide with each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    12. Slide the cross-wire to the left till the vertical cross-wire line lies
    tangentially at the 20th ring. Note the reading on the main and circular
    scale using the light emitting diode
  </p>
  <p>
    13. Now slowly slide the microscope to the right and note the reading when
    the vertical cross-wire lies tangentially at the 16th, 12th, 8th and 4th
    rings respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    14. Keep sliding the microscope to the right and again note the readings
    when the vertical cross-wire lies tangentially at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th
    and 20th rings respectively.

    15. The radius of curvature (R) of the plano-convex lens is 100 cm which can
    be calculated using the following formula
  </p>
  (6.13)
  <p align="center"> 1/f = (μg − 1) (1/R−1/Rp) ,</p>
  <p align="center">where, f = focal length of the lens = 200 cm,</p>
  <p align="center">
    μg = refractive index of the material of the lens (i.e glass) = 1.5,
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    R = Radius of curvature of one side the convex side of the plano-convex
    lens,
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    Rp = Radius of curvature of plane side of the plano-convex lens -&gt; 00.
  </p>
  <p>
    16. Plot the graph D^2 as a function of n. This should be a straight line
    passing through the origin (See Eq. 6.12)
  </p>
  <p>17. Find the slope of the line from the graph.</p>
  <p>18. Find the wavelength of sodium light from this slope using Eq. 6.12.</p>
  <p />
  <h4>
    <b>Result :</b>

  <p />
  <p>1. The wavelength of sodium light is ________ nm.</p>
