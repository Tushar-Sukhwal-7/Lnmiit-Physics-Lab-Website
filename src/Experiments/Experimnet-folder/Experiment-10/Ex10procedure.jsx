  <h4>
    <b>Apparatus Required :</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Digital Multi-meter (DMM), He-Ne laser source, sliding detector (photocell),
    optical rail and mounts.
  </p>
  <h4>
    <b>Experimental procedure</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    1. Let the laser warm up for at least fifteen minutes before starting the
    experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Position the laser at one end of the bench and align the beam so that it
    travels parallel to and along the central axis of the bench all along its
    length.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Let the beam pass through a beam expander. Adjust the slit position until
    the laser beam is incident on the full width of the slit.

  </p>
  <p>
    4. Attach the viewing screen to a component carrier and position it at the
    end of the bench furthest from the laser.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Observe the diffraction pattern on the screen. Adjust the screen position
    if necessary to obtain image clarity. Sketch the pattern observed for two
    different slit widths. What is the effect of varying the slit width?
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Now replace the screen with the sliding detector. Beware that the
    smallest division on the sliding detector is 0.01 cm, and the detector can
    be moved over a distance of 4 cm. Check that the un-obstructed laser beam is
    at the proper level to be incident on the detector central slit-adjust if
    necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Adjust the position of the slit along the optical bench until the central
    (principal) maximum and the first subsidiary maxima of the single slit
    diffraction pattern are fully extended along the direction of travel of the
    detectorâ€“obviously the pattern gets wider as the slit is moved closer to the
    laser and hence further away from the detector.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Form a clear diffraction pattern and SLOWLY scan the pattern from the
    central maxima to first maxima on the one side with the sliding detector for
    every 25 divisions of the circular scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. Plot intensity versus position. How do your results agree with
    theoretical predictions?
  </p>
  <p>10. Calculate the slit width using the diffraction Eq 10.5.</p>

  <h4>
    <b>Result :</b>
  </h4>
  <p />
  <p>The calculated slit width from the diffraction pattern a = ....... mm.</p>
  <p />
  <h4>
    <b>Precautions:</b>
  </h4>
  <p />
  <p>
    1. Never look directly into the laser beam and take care to avoid
    reflections entering your eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Do not disturb the setup once the diffraction pattern has been obtained.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Do not use the backlight of the multimeter. This would drain the battery
    of the multimeter.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Avoid stray light falling on the photo detector while measuring the
    instensity of light.
